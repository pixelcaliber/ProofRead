microprcressors began to acquire more and more computing functions. they were viewed
more as cpus rather than as programmable logié¯de€ices. mokt microcomputers are now

devices in control applications, and more powerful microprocessors are being used for
mathematical computing (number crunching), data processing, and computer graphics
applications.
our focus here is on using 8-bit microprocessors as programmable devices in
microprocessor based systems. the overwhelming majority of microprocessor applications
use s-bit processors or microcontrollers. the range of applications is very wide and
diversified—from the auto industry to home appliances. recent statistics suggest that the
wide sales of 8-bit chips is a major segment of the total number of microprocessor
